 Terminal emulator for Linux.

 OK, the main goal of this project is having a basic terminal emulator
running on Linux host machine.
 This code was ported from Gramado OS and it uses the client-side library 
for Gramado OS. Our goal is substitute the Gramado OS for Linux libraries
necessary for this work. btw 'api/' stays here just for reference, we're not
gonna use it at all.
